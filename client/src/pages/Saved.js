        //And then the promise, .then but here, what if we want to rename what comes back from axios into bookList so we donâ€™t need to type it out again. And how do we get the data from axios, we get it by receiving a response.data. So what if we want to skip the whole response part and just rename stuff here. We can destructure the response right here, in the argument. So we are destructuring an object, in this case (({data: bookList})) and rename data to bookList.
